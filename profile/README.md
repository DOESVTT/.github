## Open-source energy system models are saving the world and fueling the green transition

Our mission is to research new methodology and develop demonstration-ready energy modelling tools, that allow for <b>maximum flexibility, generality and speed while being open, secure and user-friendly</b>. This is no easy task, but to pride ourselves by saying that our tools are at the cutting edge of the field. We do this by simultanously hosting many modelling tools and research projects with similar goals, yet different focuses - and by working in close collaboration with the leading open-source energy models out there, like our friends at PyPSA and Osemosys. 

There are many open energy system models and modelling frameworks out there. We appreciate you taking the time and patience to get to know our tools, and hope they can help you in solving the novel energy system challenges. If you want to start using or developing our tools, please be in touch.

# Get to know our tools

## 1. Energy system optimization tools

We work with mixed-integer and linear optimization using GAMS, Julia and Python. All tools are capable of solving invest optimization and operation (unit commitment and scheduling) problems in multi-sectoral energy systems on local, national and continental scales.

### SpineOpt - our newest energy optimization tool with most flexible features and quick development

SpineOpt - written in Julia - includes highly flexible temporal, spatial and technological settings for optimizing capacity expansion or operation of different types of energy systems. SpineOpt can be used with Spine Toolbox as user interface. The tool includes SpineInterface package for quick model building using Julia JuMP.

SpineOpt was developed in EU project 'Spine' in 2017-2021. The development continues in EU project Mopo 2022-2026.

## Data and workflow management

### Spine Toolbox

1. Can be used with any model, multiple models, multiple data sources and multiple users.
2. Visualise data processing chains.
3. Share and control scenarios with non-modelling partners

Fully open-source Spine Toolbox was developed in EU project 'Spineâ€™ in 2017 2021. The development continues in EU project Mopo 2022 2026.
