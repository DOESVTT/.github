## Open energy system models fuel the green energy transition

Our mission is to research new methodology and develop demonstration-ready energy modelling tools, that allow for <b>maximum flexibility, generality and speed while being open, secure and user-friendly</b>. This is no easy task, but to pride ourselves by saying that our tools are at the cutting edge of the field. We do this by simultanously hosting many modelling tools and research projects with similar goals, yet different focuses - and by working in close collaboration with the leading open-source energy models out there, like our friends at PyPSA and Osemosys. 

There are many open energy system models and modelling frameworks out there. We appreciate you taking the time and patience to get to know our tools, and hope they can help you in solving the novel energy system challenges of your case. If you want to start using or developing our tools, just scroll down, install and try them out. We do our best to provide tutorials and documentation, but please excuse when we fail to be clear and let us know on our mistakes so we can work on fixing them.

# Get to know our tools:

## 1. Energy system optimization tools

We work with mixed-integer and linear optimization using GAMS, Julia and Python. All tools are capable of solving invest optimization and operation (unit commitment and scheduling) problems in multi-sectoral energy systems on local, national and continental scales. Choose between the fastest developing tool (SpineOpt); the most established tool (Backbone); or simplified tool for developing countries (IRENA FlexTool).

### SpineOpt - our newest energy optimization tool with most flexible features and ongoing progress

1. SpineOpt - written in Julia - includes highly flexible temporal, spatial and technological settings for optimizing capacity expansion or operation of different types of energy systems. 
2. SpineOpt can be used with Spine Toolbox as user interface. 
3. Includes SpineInterface package for quick model building using Julia JuMP.

SpineOpt was developed in EU project 'Spine' in 2017-2021. The development continues in EU project Mopo 2022-2026.

## Data and workflow management

### Spine Toolbox

1. Can be used with any model, multiple models, multiple data sources and multiple users.
2. Visualise data processing chains.
3. Share and control scenarios with non-modelling partners

Fully open-source Spine Toolbox was developed in EU project 'Spineâ€™ in 2017 2021. The development continues in EU project Mopo 2022 2026.
